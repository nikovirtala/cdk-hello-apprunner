# Hello AWS App Runner!

This is a minimal example of [AWS App Runner](https://aws.amazon.com/apprunner/) service deployment using [AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/).

The service we deploy is the [`hello-app-runner`](https://github.com/aws-containers/hello-app-runner) presented in the [blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/introducing-aws-app-runner/) on service launch day, and we fetch the image from [Amazon ECR Public Gallery](https://gallery.ecr.aws/aws-containers/hello-app-runner).
