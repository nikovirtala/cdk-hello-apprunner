## Build System

This project uses **Projen** for project configuration and build management. All configuration is defined in `.projenrc.ts`, and running `npx projen` regenerates project files.

**Important**: Do not manually edit generated files (marked with "Generated by projen" comments). Instead, modify `.projenrc.ts` and run `npx projen`.

- **AWS CDK**: v2.165.0 - Infrastructure as Code framework
- **TypeScript**: v5.9.3 - Primary language
- **Node.js**: v18+ - Runtime environment
- **AWS App Runner**: Alpha construct library for App Runner service deployment

## Development Tools

- **ESLint**: Code linting with TypeScript support
- **Prettier**: Code formatting
- **esbuild**: Fast TypeScript bundling
- **ts-node**: TypeScript execution
